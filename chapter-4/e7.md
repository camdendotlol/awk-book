They seem to be asking for a written answer, not a program, so here we go.

The simplest way to expand the program for multiple delimiters would be to add more blocks and more variables, e.g. a `q` tracking variable for `.Q1`-`.Q2` delimiters. This solution would get unwieldy with too many delimiters, but if we're only adding 1-2 more then I wouldn't want to over-engineer.

For a larger number of delimiters, I would use a hash similar to the `colcheck` example to store the binary status of each valid delimiter characters, e.g. `delimiters['p'] = 1`. I would create an array of valid delimiters in the `START` block (e.g. `['p', 'q', ...]`) and update the regex tests to check for the presence of any of those variables (not sure of the syntax here but I assume it's possible), and then check/update the corresponding hash value.

For nested delimiters, I would use incrementing numbers in the hash key names: `p1, p2, p3, ...`. When a `.P1` follows a previous `.P1`, we would set `delimiters['p2']` to `1`. If the next delimiter is a `.P2`, we would set `delimiters['p2']` to `0`. The `END` block would need to check that all layers are `0` when the text ends.
